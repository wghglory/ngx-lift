      <code>createTrigger</code> provides a way to manually initiate signal re-computations by referencing the trigger
      signal it creates. Its functionality is similar to RxJS Subject. With each event, you can notify the subject using
      its <code>next</code> method. Using <code>createTrigger</code> is convenient for manually triggering a "refresh"
      and responding to it in a signal-oriented manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>createTrigger</code>() returns an object with two properties: <code>next</code> and <code>value</code>. The
      <code>value</code> property indicates how many times you have triggered the signal update. The
      <code>next</code> method is used to trigger the signal update. Consequently, you can prompt the re-computation of
      any computed or effect (including <code>computedAsync</code> from ngx-lift) by accessing the signal returned when
      listening.

      Initially, <code>createTrigger's value()</code> returns 0. Whenever <code>next</code> is explicitly called, the
      value adds 1.
